Wanted to make it a real(ish) web app
	reasons:
		fun
		good practice

Installed mocha and chai
	first time writing any sort of unit test
		pretty cool

Only used one class as a container for the card data.
Wrote the rest procedurally/functionally.

"zipped" the suits and ranks together to build a deck of Card instances.
Javascript doesn't have a zip function so it's done with nested map functions.
This is how the image paths get concatenated then passed in with the "powerLevel" to create a Card object.
This ends up being a multidemensional array which ends up getting flattened later for the shuffle function.

Most of the hassle was with css html stuff. The logic was pretty straigtforward.
